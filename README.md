_Transforming vibes with AI: from raw tracks to smooth lofi_

## 🏆 Hackathon Project

**lofi-synth** is an AI-powered full-stack application built using **Next.js**, **Django**, and **Suno AI** that transforms regular music into calming lofi versions. It also leverages **emotion detection from images** to generate personalized music, and even creates entirely new lofi tracks from custom prompts.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎶 Song-to-Lofi Transformation
Upload any song, and we’ll convert it into a smooth, relaxing lofi version using **Suno AI's generative audio API**.

### 🖼️ Emotion-Based Music Generation
Upload an image → We detect the emotion in the image using **AI models** → We generate a matching lofi track based on that emotion (e.g., sad, chill, happy vibes).

### 📝 Prompt-to-Music
Type a text prompt like "a rainy night in Tokyo" → Get a custom-generated lofi audio based on the vibe and mood described.
